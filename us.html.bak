As time went                  by, we both realized how much we shared and how close we had                  grown. </p>              </div>            </div>          </div>          <div class="row timeline-element  separline"> <span class="iconsBackground">              <span class="mbr-iconfont mbri-hearth"></span> </span>            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 align-left ">              <div class="timeline-text-content">                <h4 class="mbr-timeline-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">                  The First Kiss</h4>                <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-6"> We                  kissed, there were fireworks.</p>              </div>            </div>          </div>          <div class="row timeline-element reverse separline"> <span class="iconsBackground">              <span class="mbr-iconfont mbri-hearth"></span> </span>            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 align-left">              <div class="timeline-text-content">                <h4 class="mbr-timeline-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">                  The Proposal</h4>                <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-6"> Bryan:                  Alex had swept me away on a romantic suprise birthday to                  Nashville. We absolutely love Nashville for its music, people,                  and its support of both preservation and growth of culture.                  What she didn't know was that after months of trying to plan a                  perfect and unexpected proposal, I realized that a suprise                  meant for me was the best cover. The first night we arrived                  was beautiful, and we decided to take a stroll around the                  waterfront and bridges so that I could do some photography. It                  was my plan to use this to do some scouting for a perfect                  proposal site. When we came to a spot on a small pier that                  looked across the water at the neon of Broadway, I knew it was                  there. What i didnt know was that it was NOW. I had come                  prepared and had the ring with me (just in case), but neither                  of us was dressed for the occassion. For anyone who knows us,                  this made the moment even more appropriate. Alex was dancing                  to some music on the pier waiting for me to have her pose for                  what she didnt know would be our proposal photos. We stood                  hand in hand waiting for the camera to indicate it was ready                  while I shared with her all the she has meant and means to me.                  I dont think it was until I took a knee with ring in hand that                  she was aware of just how much I truly meant what I was                  saying. There was a bunch of hugging, kissing, and happy tears                  that started one of the best nights of my life! </p>              </div>            </div>          </div>          <div class="row timeline-element "> <span class="iconsBackground"> <span                class="mbr-iconfont mbri-hearth"></span>            </span>            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 align-left ">              <div class="timeline-text-content">                <h4 class="mbr-timeline-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">                  Wedding Venue</h4>                <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-6"> We                  wanted to come together as a couple in a place that                  represented us as a couple. He's a touch raw and country.                  She's a bit city and chic. From the moment we set foot on the                  grounds at Blue Hill it felt right. Blue Hill at Stone Barns                  is at its heart a farm, its crops and livestock are its roots.                  And from those roots rose a love and appreciation of the                  elements and how with proper handling, they produce something                  refined. We love how it takes what it has at hand, and turns                  it into something amazing. </p>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </section>    <script src="assets/web/assets/jquery/jquery.min.js"></script>    <script src="assets/popper/popper.min.js"></script>    <script src="assets/tether/tether.min.js"></script>    <script src="assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>    <script src="assets/smoothscroll/smooth-scroll.js"></script>    <script src="assets/touchswipe/jquery.touch-swipe.min.js"></script>    <script src="assets/viewportchecker/jquery.viewportchecker.js"></script>    <script src="assets/dropdown/js/script.min.js"></script>    <script src="assets/theme/js/script.js"></script>    <div id="scrollToTop" class="scrollToTop mbr-arrow-up"><a style="text-align: center;"><i></i></a></div>    <input name="animation" type="hidden">  </body></html>

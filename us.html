As time went                  by, we both realized how much we shared and how close we had                  grown. </p>              </div>            </div>          </div>          <div class="row timeline-element  separline"> <span class="iconsBackground">              <span class="mbr-iconfont mbri-hearth"></span> </span>            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 align-left ">              <div class="timeline-text-content">                <h4 class="mbr-timeline-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">The

Yes, we                  spent our early months as friends sharing notes and lecture                  series but my first clear memory of an interaction with Bryan                  (was after he cut his hair). It was one of those gorgeous                  early spring days when the midday temperature just hit 60                  degrees and it felt hot on skin that was used to a 32 degree                  winter. I was coming back to our school building when I saw                  him sitting outside listening to music while studying. I                  parked myself right next to him, pulled one of my own                  earphones out of my ear and stuck it in his so he could hear                  what I was listening to.<br>                  The band was Sunset Rubdown, and the song was “The Mending of                  the Gown.” We hardly spoke, moved our heads in sync to the                  music and reviewed notes. And that was truly the beginning.<br>                  So it was only appropriate that our engagement weekend was a                  celebration of music as well – in Nashville – the city of                  music. Except that I only knew this weekend as the surprise                  birthday weekend I had planned for Bryan – not one of the                  largest milestones in our relationship. Our first evening                  would be just for the two of us – as the next few days his                  family members would start trickling in to celebrate his big                  birthday. He did not know any of this at the time either!! We                  spent the night in the city as we usually do when we travel –                  casually walking and exploring with a camera and some shared                  earphones. To note, we had actually created a playlist for the                  weekend and were listening to it at the time. We wandered over                  the pedestrian bridge onto a private park that overlooked                  downtown Broadway – whose lights were reflecting off the river                  into the dark night sky. It was definitely photo worthy.<br>                  Bryan spent awhile trying to line up his photo frame while I                  was spotting his drone, listening to music and dancing.                  Finally it was time to take our photo and he pulled me onto                  some rocks lining the river. The song playing was “I Don’t Owe                  You a Thing” by Gary Clark Jr. I then actually tried to go                  stand on the same rock he was on – he pushed me off back onto                  my own rock, held my hands and started telling me how much I                  mean to him.<br>                  You have to keep in mind, we’ve been dating for a while – so                  it’s not unusual for us to share these kinds of sentiments                  with each other and I just assumed it was another beautiful                  moment we were enjoying in each other’s company. Moments                  later, he was down on one knee, opening a box in his hand and                  asking me to be his partner in life – his wife. I can honestly                  say despite how long we’ve been dating, he was still able to                  surprise me. After our moment, and rapidly packing up all of                  our photography supplies, the ear phones went back to Gary                  Clark Jr and his perfectly timed lyrics of “I don’t owe you a                  thing, we ain’t getting married, I ain’t buying you no diamond                  ring.” We couldn’t help but laugh at the irony.</p>              </div>            </div>          </div>          <div class="row timeline-element reverse separline"> <span class="iconsBackground">              <span class="mbr-iconfont mbri-hearth"></span> </span>            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 align-left">              <div class="timeline-text-content">                <h4 class="mbr-timeline-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">                  The Proposal: Him</h4>                <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-6"> Bryan:                  Alex had swept me away on a romantic surprise birthday to                  Nashville. We absolutely love Nashville for its music, people,                  and its support of both preservation and growth of culture.                  What she didn't know was that after months of trying to plan a                  perfect and unexpected proposal, I realized that a surprise                  meant for me was the best cover. The first night we arrived                  was beautiful, and we decided to take a stroll around the                  waterfront and bridges so that I could do some photography. It                  was my plan to use this to do some scouting for a perfect                  proposal site. When we came to a spot on a small pier that                  looked across the water at the neon of Broadway, I knew it was                  there. What I didn't know was that it was NOW. I had come                  prepared and had the ring with me (just in case), but neither                  of us was dressed for the occasion. For anyone who knows us,                  this made the moment even more appropriate. Alex was dancing                  to some music on the pier waiting for me to have her pose for                  what she didn't know would be our proposal photos. We stood                  hand in hand waiting for the camera to indicate it was ready                  while I shared with her all the she has meant and means to me.                  I don't think it was until I took a knee with ring in hand                  that she was aware of just how much I truly meant what I was                  saying. There was a bunch of hugging, kissing, and happy tears                  that started one of the best nights of my life! </p>              </div>            </div>          </div>          <div class="row timeline-element "> <span class="iconsBackground"> <span                class="mbr-iconfont mbri-hearth"></span>            </span>            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 align-left ">              <div class="timeline-text-content">                <h4 class="mbr-timeline-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">                  Wedding Venue</h4>                <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-6"> We                  wanted to come together as a couple in a place that                  represented us as a couple. He's a touch raw and Southern.                  She's a bit city and chic. From the moment we set foot on the                  grounds at Blue Hill it felt right. Blue Hill at Stone Barns                  is at its heart a farm, its crops and livestock are its roots.                  And from those roots rose a love and appreciation of the                  elements and how with proper handling, they produce something                  refined. We love how it takes what it has at hand, and turns                  it into something amazing. </p>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </section>    <script src="assets/web/assets/jquery/jquery.min.js"></script>    <script src="assets/popper/popper.min.js"></script>    <script src="assets/tether/tether.min.js"></script>    <script src="assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>    <script src="assets/smoothscroll/smooth-scroll.js"></script>    <script src="assets/touchswipe/jquery.touch-swipe.min.js"></script>    <script src="assets/viewportchecker/jquery.viewportchecker.js"></script>    <script src="assets/dropdown/js/script.min.js"></script>    <script src="assets/theme/js/script.js"></script>    <div id="scrollToTop" class="scrollToTop mbr-arrow-up"><a style="text-align: center;"><i></i></a></div>    <input name="animation" type="hidden">  </body></html>

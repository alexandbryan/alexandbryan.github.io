                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Bryan: &nbsp; &nbsp;Alex had swept me away on a romantic suprise birthday to Nashville. We absolutely love Nashville for its music, people, and its support of both preservation and growth of culture.  What she didn't know was that after months of trying to plan a perfect and unexpected proposal, I realized that a suprise meant for me was the best cover. &nbsp;The first night we arrived was beautiful, and we decided to take a stroll around the waterfront and bridges so that I could do some photography. &nbsp;It was my plan to use this to do some scouting for a perfect proposal site. When we came to a spot on a small pier that looked across the water at the neon of Broadway, I knew it was there. &nbsp;What i didnt know was that it was NOW. &nbsp;I had come prepared and had the ring with me (just in case), but neither of us was dressed for the occassion. &nbsp;For anyone who knows us, this made the moment even more appropriate. &nbsp;Alex was dancing to some music on the pier waiting for me to have her pose for what she didnt know would be our proposal photos. &nbsp;We stood hand in hand waiting for the camera to indicate it was ready while I shared with her all the she has meant and means to me. &nbsp;I dont think it was until I took a knee with ring in hand that she was aware of just how much I truly meant what I was saying. &nbsp;There was a bunch of hugging, kissing, and happy tears that started one of the best nights of my life!<br><br><br>

She's a bit city and chic. &nbsp; From the moment we set foot on the grounds at Blue Hill it felt right. Blue Hill at Stone Barns is at its heart a farm, its crops and livestock are its roots. &nbsp;And from those roots rose a love and appreciation of the elements and how with proper handling, they produce something refined. &nbsp; We love how it takes what it has at hand, and turns it into something amazing. &nbsp;<br><br><br></div></h4>
